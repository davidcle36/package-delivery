D.  Identify a self-adjusting data structure, such as a hash table, that can be used with the algorithm identified
    in part A to store the package data.


    1.  Explain how your data structure accounts for the relationship between the data points you are storing.

        For self-adjusting data structures, a chaining hash table. When collision happens in the bucket, it append
        the key-value pair regardless if there are empty space elsewhere. As long as collision is kept minimum, the
        look up, insert, and delete is O(1)

        For storing data, the key is the name of the instance of the class, and the value is the instance of the class.
