1.  Describe at least two strengths of the algorithm used in the solution.

The algorithm I used is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, which is comprise
of a weighted graph and also a hash table for quick loop up.

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm Advantage:
    -   Finding the shortest distance between one point to another while
        algorithm itself while keeping the time complexity low.

    -   It can calculate the minimum weight between vertices and can trace
        the route from beginning to end.
