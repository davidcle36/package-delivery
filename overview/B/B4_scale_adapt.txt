As the growing number packages increase, the program will be able to minimize the distance
as well as miles for maximum numbers of packages delivered by the end of the day. By using
Dijkstra's shortest path, it will dynamically change the route according to the packages to
the shortest distance as possible.

However, as the number of packages grows so does the time to complete it. This can cause
scaling issue due to the time complexity being O(N^3 * 4LogN) for building undirected graph,
chunking and sorting, and find shortest route. Beside refactoring the codebase to make it more
efficient, it is possible to cache the hash table distance between in a database to reduce recreating
already known path. Any new streets can be updated into the hash table. This way, a viable method of
scaling can be done.
