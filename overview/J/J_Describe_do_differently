J.  Describe what you would do differently, other than the two algorithms
    identified in I3, if you did this project again.

        The chucking and sorting algorithm computation is high due to calling dijstra's
        algorithm more than one in the program. Going back, I would refactor that first
        to reduce the time complexity of the program. One approach is caching and popping packages
        when loading to a truck from the same address. This way can save time and space.

        Second is optimizing which package is loaded and at what time. I had to restrict what
        can be loaded manually until specific time, thus, mileage usage was less optimize.

        Lastly, the organization of code can be better. Many codes were repeated and when changes
        are needed, I would have to change in 2 or more places or else it will case problem.
