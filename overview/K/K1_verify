1.  Verify that the data structure used in the solution meets all requirements in the scenario.
    a.  Explain how the time needed to complete the look-up function is affected by changes
        in the number of packages to be delivered.

            Regardless of number of packages, the time complexity is O(1) due to getting the value by a unique key.

    b.  Explain how the data structure space usage is affected by changes in the number of packages to be delivered.

            There are no change to the space complexity as it is still O(V). The data inside the hash table is the same,
            unless one is updating its value, but the space complexity does not change but the number can change by O(1)
            if packages are removed from table when delivered.

    c.  Describe how changes to the number of trucks or the number of cities would affect the look-up time and
        the space usage of the data structure.

            If there was 20 trucks having to look for a package by a unique id, it will be a constant value of 20, so
            the time and space complexity is still O(1).
