        Graph Data Structure:
        
               After a Hash Table has been built for each location and the respective miles as vertex. Then when added to graph, each
            vertex has a label, and a list of miles from that vertex to others. Knowing the distance between
            point A to point B, a weighted(undirected) graph can be created.

            Building an undirected graph:
                Class: Graph

                    Using a hash table, with the key being the address, and the values
                    being the edge's weight between it and the many vetices. It provides the
                    time complexity of O(1) when searching, or updated by address.

                    Another hash table that is initialize is edge_weights, which holds the value of between two points given
                    the time complexity of O(1) when searching (address A, address B).

                    The time complexity to build undirected graph is N + (N * N) = O(N * N)
                    The space complexity is O(V + E) where V are the vertices and E are the edge's weights

        Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm:
            
                The algorithm computes the shortest path from the initial given vertex to all other
            vertices in the graph. Two data members are required in the vertex are the total distance
            from start to another vertex. Also, reference to the previous vertex.
            
                The Dijkstra shortest path is somewhat similar as a link list, where one points directly to address, 
            and the it is object of an instance. But essentially the same thing. It is like a link list but the link
            carries weight as the vertex connect to its adjacent vertices. As for this program, it is the distance.
            The time complexity of Dijkstra shortest path O(|V| * |E| log |E|) where V is the number of vertices, 
            and E is number of edge's weight between vertices. Since the further away from starting point, the greater amount of
            adjacent vertex connect to it, and vice versa. For examples, starting vertex, V, is equal to N vertices
            adjacent to it. For the number of edges, between some vertex_a* and another vertex_b*, an edge must exist, 
            and worst case, one travel through all the edges to get to target, O(LogE) times. And in the end, the value 
            holding the smallest index is pop, which added E times to the algorithms since it might need to pop the first index
            and then shift the array over by one. Thus making it O(|V| + |E| log |E|)
            
                But with a hash table, a shifting is not a problem since each items are placed in a bucket. Thus, in the codebase
            for dijkstra_shortest_path time complexity is O(|V| + Log |E|) since the hash function remove smallest index 
            takes O(1 + M) or O(1) without the need to shift the list over, and M is  number of collision in the hash table.
            
                The space complexity is O(|V| + |E|), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges

        Edge's Weight Comparison Sorting:
            
                After building an undirected graph, a method can be used to compared the distance between
            vertex_a and vertex_b to find the minimum with Dijkstra and break them into list of package ids. The package ids
            would call a getter to get in instance of that Package, thus, getting the address, notes, time, etc.
            
                For the Edge's weight comparison, the codebase would use two package addresses to get the distance 
            between them from the hash table, Graph.edge_weights. The key to search for the distance between the vertex 
            is a tuple(vertex_a, vertex_b), which was already set up when the undirected graph was built. Since the
            max packages per truck, the sorted route list will be at max 16.
            
            The Time complexity is O(N^3 * log |E|)
            The space complexity is O(V + E)
            
            * As I was having problem sorting it, I have to manually count how much packages a truck can get at a time,
              and the special notes condition as much as I could without going over 140 miles while fulfilling deadline.
